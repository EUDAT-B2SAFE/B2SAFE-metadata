Metadata component is an extension of the B2SAFE core package (https://github.com/EUDAT-B2SAFE/B2SAFE-core).
To install it you have to do following steps:

- install the software the metadata component relies to:
 - iRODS
 - B2SAFE
 - Neo4j
 - messaging system (optional)
 - python
 - py2neo library v2.0.8


- clone (master branch) the metadata component from GitHub https://github.com/EUDAT-B2SAFE/B2SAFE-metadata.git
- add all folders except "rulebase" to <your path to B2SAFE>/B2SAFE-core/scripts/metadata 
	and the rules from rulebase folder to the "rulebase" folder of your iRODS instance <your path to B2SAFE>/B2SAFE-core/rulebase
- modify configuration files according to your environment as described in "Configuration files" page of the wiki
- check for missing python libraries trying to run the major scripts (under <your path to B2SAFE>/B2SAFE-core/scripts/metadata/cmd/) with -d (dry run) option
    - mets_factory.py
    - b2safe_neo4j_client.py
Try to install missing packages with the standard package manager like apt, yum, zypper etc.
If packages are not within the standards install and use pip to install the missing packages.

- test with the test scripts under <your path to B2SAFE>/B2SAFE-core/scripts/metadata/test/B2Safe_neo4j_client_test. Be aware that then your neo4j DB needs to be cleaned up, as the test will create a graph containing "collection_A" in the name of the root node with type "digitalCollection".

As described in the "Architecture" page of the wiki, the iRODS rules trigger the scripts except the b2safe_neo4j_client.py for that a cronjob is needed.
